    'ðŸ¤– Ready to learn machine learning? ðŸš€ Discover this 7-step study plan by Patrick, a machine learning developer advocate. From math basics to Kaggle competitions, this guide provides everything you need to know! #MachineLearning #Python #DataScience #Kaggle #AI',
  detailed_summary:
    'The video gives a seven-step learning path for machine learning, starting with basic math and Python, and moving on to key Python libraries, an extensive machine learning course and hands-on practice on Kaggle.com. The video also provides tips for job search and suggests starting a blog to deepen knowledge and increase chances of getting an interview. Two books are recommended for those preferring to learn through books.',
  key_phrases: [
    'I divided this learning path into seven steps that should take you about three months to finish.',
    "The demand for machine learning engineers is still increasing every year. So it's a great skill to have.",
    'The most popular and in my opinion also one of the best ones is the machine learning specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera.',
    'ML Ops is a whole field on its own. So I may cover this in a separate video.'

  assessement:
    "Sure, here's a quiz based on the text you provided:\n\n1. Knowing math is not necessary for machine learning.\n- False. Knowing the underlying math provides a better understanding of how the algorithms work and makes it easier to solve problems. Plus, math can add to the excitement of the topic.\n- Fun fact: Alan Turing was known for creating the concept of the Universal Machine, which was a mathematical notion that laid the foundation for computer science.\n\n2. Kaggle is a great platform to practice machine learning and build a portfolio.\n- True. Kaggle provides thousands of data sets and challenges to help build machine learning skills. It can also be used to develop a portfolio of projects and demonstrate skills to potential employers.\n- Fun fact: Kaggle was acquired by Google in 2017 but continues to operate as a separate subsidiary.",
